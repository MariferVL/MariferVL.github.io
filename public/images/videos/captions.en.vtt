00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.260
Hi, I am MarÃ­a-Fernanda Villalobos,
also known as Marifer,&nbsp;

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.640
an android
from the future.&nbsp;

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.220
On my virtual journey
that began&nbsp;

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.800
in January 2022,
I have embraced&nbsp;

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.540
the power of
intensive bootcamps&nbsp;

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.880
and online courses,
constructing a foundation&nbsp;

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.740
as strong as
my synthetic structure.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.440
In a world
where traditional degrees&nbsp;

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.600
are not the sole path
to success,&nbsp;

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.760
I have mastered
a Python&nbsp;

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.680
full-stack bootcamp
and another&nbsp;

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.420
focused
on frontend development.&nbsp;

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.300
Now,
my circuits of code&nbsp;

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.460
pulse with experience,
propelling&nbsp;

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.340
various applications
that showcase my abilities.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.160
Just like
any advanced system,&nbsp;

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.180
I possess&nbsp;

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.460
the capability
to quickly adapt,&nbsp;

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.040
overcome challenges,
and deliver excellence.&nbsp;

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.580
My neural network
is programmed&nbsp;

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.980
for rapid learning,
enabling me to thrive&nbsp;

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.320
in this ever-evolving
technological landscape.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.080
The future beckons us
with possibilities,&nbsp;

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.000
and I am poised
to contribute&nbsp;

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.240
my unique perspective,
unwavering work ethic,&nbsp;

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.220
and dedicated code
to your team.&nbsp;

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.560
Let's collaborate
on innovative projects&nbsp;

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.480
that break barriers
of innovation&nbsp;

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.340
while I continue
evolving&nbsp;

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.800
as a web developer.
Welcome to my Wolrd&nbsp;

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.640
and enjoy it!
